package app
  -node 
  -mongo
  -app

benefits:
  -keeps track of versions used in specific apps
    ex: one app may use node 14, another app uses node 9
  -we can safely remove an application with all of its dependencies
  -consistently build, run, and ship aplications

container vs virtual machine
  -mac can run windows or linux with a hypervisor
  -vitual machine lets us run an application in isolation: has exact dependencies that it needs
  -problem w/ vitual machine:
    -each VM needs OS
      -slow, resource intensive
  -container: run multi apps in isolation
    -use OS of host
      -lightweight
      -start quickly
