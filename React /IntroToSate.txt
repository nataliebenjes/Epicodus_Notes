setState()
  when we want to know about current state and props, pass in the following arrow function:
    (state, props) => stateChange
why would we want to know about current state?
  -we want to toggle a boolean: to toggle it to its opposite state
  -We want to increment or decrement a value: counter that could be incremented by one every time you click a value.
  -We want to update the sate of a game

unidirectional data flow
  -in react, data can only flow from parent to child component
  -can only pass props DOWNNN
  -we need callbacks
    1. define a method in parent component that has state
    2. parent component passes this method into child component as a prop. functions can be props just like any other  data types
    3. we will add this method to a function in our child component in the form of a callbacks
    4. when child executes the function that contains the parent component's callback, the method in the parent component is invoked.
