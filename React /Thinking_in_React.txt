step 1
Break the UI into a component hierarchy

step 2
build a static version in react

step 3
find the minimal but complete representation of UI state

  things that are state:
  1. search text : changes over time and isn't computed from anything
  2. value of checkbox
  
4. identify where your state should live
  1. identify every component that renders something based on that state
  2. find their closest common parent component
  3. dicide where the state should live
    -

5. Add inverse data flow
  -to support changing state according to user input
  -in component that will have state changed, add "onChange" event handlers and set the parent state from them
